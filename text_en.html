    <p id="head-text">Today's shareable text is almost entirely in the process of being constructed through technology on the screen and by machines. The appearance of countless texts we read is placed in front of us, determined by specific technology or software and output machines. However, the proposition that there is a container beneath the text, and that the text exists by relying on the container, is too often ignored.<br><br>

    <em>Free Document Format</em> believes that current shareable text and document formats can be implemented in a way that is both alternative and better. This leads to demands for change for free documents and books. How should the publishing method and the resulting document change and be different? To answer this question, <em>Free Document Format</em> creates, critiques, and documents the process of creating a new document sharing format through other electronic & open source publishing formats that have been produced so far. Texts will be shared again, and new questions about free documents will flow anew.</p>


    <h2 id="section7">Introduction</h2>
    <section>
        <p>Here is a text to be recorded and delivered. It was written in the plain and universal way, by typing. There are roughly two ways to share this text with a large number of people. Someone uploads this text to a server and shares its location coordinates so that anyone can access the link (location coordinates) through a screen. The text transferred to the medium must be shared.</p>

        <p>The shared text<span class="n1"><span class="n2">It is a word that refers to the text that is to be recorded and transmitted to others, that is, to be shared.</span></span>, the form of the 'document', gives a familiar impression of paper. However, all of this process takes place on the screen. Even if it is printed and left in the hand as a material, it is the result of being digitally created through a machine called a computer until then. In other words, the current shareable text is almost always in the process of being composed by technology beyond the screen and through machines. The appearance of numerous texts we read is placed in front of us, determined and embodied by specific technologies or softwares aswell as output and display machines. However, the proposition that there is a vessel to contain it under the text, and that the text exists by relying on the vessel, is often ignored.</p>


        <p>Moreover, most of today's books are eventually produced in the same way through one software (program). It is also a software that operates in a structure with a hidden principle that those who actually use it do not understand. The design and UI of this proprietary software device closes the possibility of the operator fully mastering the software that is the tool they use, leaving the operator disconnected from the tool and placed at the end of the chain.</p>

        <p>In Free Document Format, we believe that current shareable text and document formats can be implemented in a way that is both alternative and better. This leads to demands for change for free documents and books. How can the publishing method, the resulting document, and the format be different? We should be critical and question the format of the current document floating on the screen and the way it is formatted</p>

        <p>How can we, who have been deprived of our sovereignty even though we are users of actual tools, revive and protect the freedom of creation again? The effort to be free is for oneself. We need democratization of tools. If you can properly understand and use the technology and format you use, what other concerns and ideas can we have in the future?</p>

        <p>Following these questions, Free Document Format creates, critiques, and documents the process of creating a new document sharing format through other electronic publishing formats that have been produced so far. We will explore and devise various document formats and systems beyond the current proprietary one, but the biggest purpose is not to impose a new solution, but to give you a choice. The text toward possibility will be shared again, and new questions about free documents will flow anew.</p>

    <h2>The imagined future</h2>

    <section>
        <p>A Manifesto was written.<br> 
        Subsequent documents could no longer be the same as before.<br>
        People started asking. Began to doubt and realize.<br>
        Why haven't we done that until now?</p>

        <p>Free documentation has become a vessel to achieve the ideal of content that is accessible to anyone, without the need for translation of software, format, or form. It perfectly mirrors and corresponds to the linked community, the effort to create a common platform on the Internet, and the utopian, translingual dream.</p>

        <p>Digital documents, not imitations of paper, and editions that combine print and digital must have been new at some point in the past. There was a time of longing when a new and true document, a pure hybrid dream, stirred and inflamed people! But now it has become a relic of the past. Because everyone now shares the thesis that documents do not sit within a single form. There is no concept of union because you cannot see a difference between them. Text exists in a document format that can be expanded infinitely, and the document format is one and infinite</p>

        <p>Documents that were freed from being confined to one frame grew up according to each other, reflecting each other in form and content. It was possible because it could be anything. Documents are now the complete embodiment of content, and in themselves, content</p>

        <p>All of this was constructed without anyone's monopoly or restrictions. Now anyone can access the community from anywhere and create, save and share documents without having to install anything. All pages are connected, swimming in a sea of ​​servers. One moment only me, another moment everyone can see the same document. A document is like a liquid that can change into any form. It was linear, then it was non-linear, it spreads like air particles, and then moves like flowing water.</p>

        <p>Free documents that can be transformed into any format without restrictions have the potential to be expanded to accommodate numerous readings in their own way. Through active reading thanks to documents that are transformed and expanded according to choices, people have become dynamic beings who truly relate to documents, discover new selves in the text, and change.<span class="n1"><span class="n2">Soohyun Yeo. (2020). <em>A study on rhizome characteristics of reading</em>, Korean Elementary Education, 31(1), 233-243.</span></span> The same was true for texts and documents. The future faces endless new creation. </p>

        <p>The ways of reading letters are also innumerable. Some people quickly turn documents one by one to make them look like flowing images, and when their eyes hurt, they close their eyes and turn the text as audio to listen. Others printed it out into clothes and read through wearing it, sat on the sofa at home in a virtual space and read the text in the printed newspaper format, or when they suddenly got tired of all of it, they painted the entire house with braille text and read it through touching it.</p>

        <p>A world that is manipulated by the reader and creates new stories. Our document is a multiplex that welcomes others without reducing them to recognition. It is inside and outside at the same time. It is everywhere and nowhere, always present and non-existent. Documents are beautifully connected to each other by links, the boundaries between documents, and the boundaries between writers and readers are blurred, and like the form of a rhizome, they become a network of small roots rather than a single entity, aiming for their own growth and expansion. It is a world of letters that are simultaneously expanded and contracted in all directions in a four-dimensional space and are connected by densely connected roots.</p>

        <p>When the future we had been persistently fantasizing about arrived, people began to explore their own imaginations. The liquid continues to flow along the roots of imagination.</p>

    <h2>Theory of Free Documentation </h2>

    <p>What is a free document in reality right now? What should it be free from? How can it be made? In order to get a clue of the answer, I first want to analyze and interpret PDF, the main document sharing format so far. Let's take a look at the invisible mechanism of the current document method. Why is the current format established despite its inherent flaws, and why is it maintained without major reforms? We'll take a look at what the document format has gone through to date, and what it may or may not be in the future.</p>

    <p>After that, I will take a look at the theories that evoke the possibility of free documentation. Are there characteristics and functions that cannot be accomplished with the current document format, but that the new document format of the future could possess? Or do they already exist and have been discussed? Have we been missing out on discovering them?</p>

    <h3>A Document</h3>

    <section>
    <h4>Reappropriation of a root</h4>

    <p>DTP stands for Desktop Publishing, and refers to the work of designing publications such as books or dictionaries on a personal computer. A typical modern desktop publication is created via a WYSIWYG word processor/text editor such as Microsoft Word (.doc), edited and designed with a layout program such as InDesign, then exported to PDF and printed.</p>

    <p>At present, it is difficult to imagine a document produced without digital intervention, whether in manufacturing or distribution. Almost everything that reaches our senses through technological mediation goes through a digital ‘pass-through’. You may be reading this document in a tactile, printed version, but the entire process of writing and editing this document was done digitally beyond the screen. However, the format and term ‘document’ gives shared texts the familiar image of a rectangular piece of paper, so the digital nature of documents, books and our reading behavior is easily ignored.</p>

    <p>Just because documents are produced in a digital environment does not mean that digital documents should be prioritized. In the first place, it is said that digital documents are essential to create a 'book'. Comparing books and digital on both ends of the opposite pole is now terribly boring. This comparison need not to exist any more. Books will not disappear just because digital documents exist, nor will digital documentslag behind books and disappear again.<span class="n1"><span class="n2">If you are curious about the reason why digitally produced documents are eventually printed and maintained as a book, there are too many reasons to write down and list the matter. Because no modern web alternative can match the instant trust and value you get when holding a beautifully crafted and printed book.</span></span> It is not a matter of whether books or digital documents come first, but rather the dichotomous distinction itself. The fixed notion of thinking of digital texts and documents as an alternative to printed editions must be abandoned. The two are intrinsically linked, just two branches growing from a single root.</p>


    <h4>After the Hybrid</h4>

    <p>These days publications generally produce both formats based on one text in order not to give up both. And documents with a more developed creativity, which want to deviate a little from the norm, have made efforts to create a document format that combines the characteristics of both polarities.</p>

    <p>Alessandro Ludovico, in his book <em>Post Digital Print</em>, which discusses publishing after digital print, argues that in the future there will be more mixtures of digital and print, called hybrids. He said that the forms of documents that are intrinsically and inherently connected will influence each other and create a new mixed form, and only when it can no longer be clearly classified as ‘print’ or ‘electronic publication’ is a true mixed form of publication. As an example in his 2012 book, Ludovico also talked about imagining ‘print sampling’, which allows you to create custom content (compilations) in a form similar to music or video sampling.<span class="n1"><span class="n2"> Alessandro Ludovico, <em>Post Digital Print</em>, p.155</span></span> If you look at the current E-book readers or Web2Print systems, you will be able to feel strongly that the imagination of the time is already becoming a reality and a phenomenon.</p>

    <p>But in addition to this, what kind of change could happen if everyone really shared the perception that the two are not different trees, but fundamentally connected branches, which is eventually a single tree? After transcending 'hybrid', what awaits us?</p>

    <h3>Flowing document</h3>

    <section>
    <h4>Paper under the glass</h4>

    <p>Portable Document Format, hereinafter PDF, is a document file format (type) created by Adobe Systems, USA. It appeared in 1993 when Adobe released PDF 1.0 version and Acrobat 1.0 version. As a result, PDF is now the de facto industry standard for printable documents online, with no rivals. Advantages of PDF include that most documents can be expressed as they are, content cannot be tampered with through encryption and compression technology, licenses can be granted in various ways, and that various programs can support it.</p>

    <p>The essence of PDF lies in being able to share the form ‘as is’. A sense of trust that comes from integrity, that it is identical to the original. It is the same aesthetic as the photo. However, if you look at this beautiful quality of integrity through the lens of readability, the way you see PDFs will change dramatically. A PDF file, spearheaded by Acrobat, is in fact a chunk of data that perfectly represents the typesetting text. There is no hierarchy in the structure of this data. But Adobe has managed a surprising turn of context, convincing the world that this block of typesetting is the best format for storing, sharing and reading documents. A still PDF, like a photograph, is a perfect simulator of <em>“paper under glass”</em><span class="n1"><span class="n2"> Ted Nelson, </em>Geeks Bearing Gift: How the computer world got this way</em>(2008), p.127 <a href="http://thetednelson.com/geeksbearinggifts.php">http://thetednelson.com/geeksbearinggifts.php</a></span></span> that is very imprecise to read and impossible to annotate. With nothing to gain, the paper gets trapped under the glass and loses its own strength and charm. After all, people read the text by printing the PDF file, which is already in the form of paper, onto another paper in the real world – which is not trapped under glass. It is a system that not only prints to read, but must.</p>


    <h4>Liquid Layout</h4>

    <p class="indent">
    Edward R. Tufte, who writes about information design, seeks to explain the problems he faces in the context of web design, recognizing the mismatch between the physical world and the way it is represented. “While we daily explore the perceptual world of three-dimensional space, and sometimes reason about higher-dimensional realms with mathematical ease, the world depicted on our information displays is haunted by the two-dimensionality of the endless plains of paper and video screens.”<span class="n1"><span class="n2">  Dan Rubin, <em>“Off Page”</em>, Back Office 3. <a href="">http://www.revue-backoffice.com/en/issues/03-writing-the-screen/02_rubin</a>http://www.revue-backoffice.com/en/issues/03-writing-the-screen/02_rubin</span></span></p>

    <p>The web has never been intended to replace print. Of course, all of this may be happening because it was an evolutionary step, but what is clear is that the Web is not a clone of a digitally distributed material world with a few decorative add-ons.</p>

    <p>Earlier, we mentioned that PDF, an electronic document format, is a de facto industry standard as a document sharing format. In fact, we understand not only the PDF, but also the web itself, which is imagined as a wide world that goes beyond two dimensions, by substituting each of them with a ‘web page’, which is a rectangular piece of paper. The World Wide Web(WWW) also operates on the same concept as a bundle of pages and a huge codex. The concept of the page is so familiar and natural in its history that, without even noticing, it connected history and meaning to the Web, which imposes on our entire thought process. And this mapping of the concept of a page to the web has had a profound impact on the way creators design, create, edit, and curate content. It will take a very long time to shed the page paradigm from the current web and implement a world of document perception like our physical world. If you can't get away from the current page concept right now, shouldn't you first think about how to properly define the boundaries of a page on the web.</p>

    <p>Dan Rubin uses the term <em>liquid layout</em> to describe digital compositions whose layouts are readjusted according to possible sizes, such as the dimensions of a sheet of paper or a web browser window, as opposed to the fixed blocks of the traditional letterpress process. In liquid layout, we abandon this familiar method of recreating the page inside the page to draw a border and re-composing the text on the border. Unlike text that is stuck in a fixed layout, text in a liquid layout flows like water and changes freely according to requirements and choices. Writing adapts to the many media we encounter every day, and changes into a form that best suits the most important purpose of a document, the desire to share information, and the most important virtue of a document, the purpose of being well-read. A layout that flows like a liquid is both an imaginable future and a reality. How will documents change in the future if we experience a paradigm shift in which sentences, paragraphs, and documents can flow freely? Can documents that flow out of paper go far and get beyond the borders of two-dimensionality?</p>


    <h5>Adobe's Fluidization</h5>


    <p>In 2020, Adobe added a new reading mode for Acrobat Reader called Liquid Mode. It is a function that AI automatically rips and rearranges PDF documents so that they can be viewed comfortably as documents flowing on a small screen, and it is said that Sensi, its own AI, was used. (The use of the metaphor of liquid, a document that flows equally in these documents inside Adobe software, would prove that the metaphor is useful.) When the mode is activated, a table of contents that works as a kind of hyperlink is automatically created, and a customizing function that allows the user to adjust the font size, character spacing, and line spacing as desired is also configured. In our tests, converting from horizontal text-heavy PDFs is shockingly fast, and it works pretty smoothly.</p>

    <p>The original ability and purpose of 'Acrobat Reader' is to read and handle PDF based on fixed pages. However, it is obvious why the text sharing (viewing) format adds the act of emphasizing this liquefied document format inside Acrobat, that is, the format of forcibly remodeling even though it is a document that was not originally born that way. It's proof that the PDF itself knows that it's not in its best shape and doesn't offer an optimal reading experience.</p>

    <p>On July 23, 2022, Adobe posted a guide called ‘<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/alternate-layouts-liquid-layouts.html">Liquid Layouts and Alternate Layouts</a>’ on its support page. It says –“Alternate layouts and Liquid Layout page rules, give you the flexibility to efficiently design for multiple page sizes, orientations, or aspect ratios. <br> For publishing for multiple formats and sizes, you can choose a design strategy that suits a project best: Hand crafted, semi-automated, or fully automated. The degree of design control decreases as you rely on automated workflows. InDesign provides several enhancements for your adopted strategy to balance cost and control.” But also they noted that Automatic Liquid Layout based-publishing is not possible yet, because of the unavailability of compliant viewer technologies.<span class="n1"><span class="n2">This is a disappointing feature of proprietary paid software. Until (and even after) machine and technology companies build and release products, real workers work at the end of the production line, and it's very difficult or impossible to influence development or compatibility.</span></span></p>

    <p>Even if they are aware of this reality, figuring out the problem and trying to solve it would be an advantage and a starting point. However, the very nature of PDF is so strong that such a change must face two questions.</p>

    <p class="indent"><em>Where does the dignity of integrity go?<br>
    Shouldn't the chicken come before the egg?</em></p>

    <p>There are clearly areas where integrity must be maintained. There are also documents that require signatures, documents that require consistency with official forms, and documents that need to be shared in the same shape and size to avoid discrimination. And these documents are satisfied with the current static fixed format, and are shared based on their rigidity. But how far did Adobe and Adobe's liquefaction mode respond to these concerns? First of all, when creating a PDF with the current Adobe Creative Cloud Creative Cloud program, there was no case of asking permission for the document viewing mode to be switched to this ‘Liquid Mode’. If you look at it differently, this is the beginning of a very sharp conflict. Many PDFs that are currently created and shared are documents that do not reveal or do not have the hierarchy and guidelines set by the creators according to their unique creation and data handling methods, so the documents are converted depending on different criteria than that specified by the creator. If so, the loss of what you believed in will rather be the shock of betrayal as great as the concentration of trust.</p>

    <p>The second question is about the source. It follows naturally that the sequence of solutions is very wrong. Rather than modifying the way documents are produced in order to change them, how should we be persuaded of the process of forcibly tearing apart and reassembling documents that have already been produced differently? Now that additional updates are proving that the destination of change is clear, a change in a specific software program or a fundamental system is required to modify our cognition. Even if you don't dream too big and start from the very begenning, if it's not difficult, why would you choose the other way around?</p>


    <h5>After it starts to flow</h5>


    <p>When it starts to flow out of the rectangular frame of the paper under the glass, there are things to consider. In most digital reading experiences, we don't get the visceral, experiential ‘physical’ cues we get from reading a paper book. When reading a paper book, our minds map the physical space of each spread (page), just as we map a city when we take a walk. For example, anyone can sensibly recall information as specific as a favorite quote was in the top left corner about three-quarters of the way through the book.<span class="n1"><span class="n2">Arthur Attwell, <em>“Why you love reading on paper (and what it means for ebooks)”</em>, Electric Book Works, 2021년 9월 21일, <a href="">https://electricbookworks.com/thinking/reading-on-paper/</a>https://electricbookworks.com/thinking/reading-on-paper/</span></span></p>

    <p> But since there is no topography on a flat screen viewed through glass, the reflexive effort to map the book in one's mind struggles. It becomes difficult to figure out where our reading is now and where to go. In documents without pagination,  how should the 'reading sense' be formed? How can a new reading sense be constructed and designed? It seems that markers can be cited as the first step to start this imagination. Documents under glass with physical properties removed, and markers for documents with scrolls that transcend pagination should have a different principle and look. An index system can also be a good example. A game-changing approach to index creation is needed. A good index is very useful. A well-crafted index can also serve as a taxonomy of concepts, a map of the ideas in a book. If you move the hyperlink to the automatically updated location, you will be able to activate the index system that required a lot of labor for marking.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, Dan Rubin wants to bring the question back to the root of imagination.</p>

    <p class="indent">We talk at length about experience, emotional design, content strategy, visual grammar, psychology, usability, and standards, but none of them really challenge the way we work, the way we think about the larger concept of what we’re actually capable of doing with this incredible network of wires, satellites, servers, ideas, and people.[...] <strong>Our responsibility is not to replace “page” in our unique vocabulary of Web design but to acknowledge that our current understanding of what it means to design for the Web is just a single blip in a universe of possibilities.</strong> We are still only scratching the surface of what is actually possible.</p>

    <h3>Connected Document </h3>

    <h4>Hypertext: Drift, float, become vapor</h4>

    <p class="indent">‘It is not the computer itself that permanently changes the linearity of the text, but the software’s ability to create a functional and entirely new text structure in an abstract digital space: hypertext.’</p>

    <p>A document that allows you to move to another text or image by clicking on a link is called 'hypertext'. Hypertext, which has become synonymous with web documents, is a technology designed to help provide additional information and cross-reference between documents. The web has been built around documents from the beginning. When Tim Berners-Lee devised the World Wide Web(WWW) to facilitate information sharing, the format of that information was a hypertext document.</p>

    <figure class="bigimg">
        <img src="fig/Xanadu_Schematic.png">
        <figcaption>A panoramic view of postulated hypertext from Ted's 1965 paper on the subject. <a href="https://www.notion.so/blog/ted-nelson">https://www.notion.so/blog/ted-nelson</a></figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The composition of paper books has been systematized over the centuries. Sentences are logically combined to form paragraphs, and paragraphs have a complete structure in the form of an introduction, body, and conclusion. additional information is commented out to keep the flow intact. A text has a directivity or linearity that begins in either the left or right direction and ends in the opposite direction.</p>

    <p>However, hypertext destroys this linearity. Hypertext is fundamentally an intertext made up of texts that cannot be woven/made in a paper book. It can be said that it is an inherent property of the first digital base that cannot be effectively reproduced through printing. Literary critics point out several characteristics, citing the characteristics of hypertext and similarities between post-structuralism and postmodernism (Kim Jae-guk, 2001). <span class="n1"><span class="n2"></span>Jaeguk Kim (2001), <em>Cyberism and Cyber Novels</em>, National Institute of Korean Studies.</span></p>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>Fluidity and imprecision of representation or representation systems</li>
        <li>The importance of avant-garde experimentation, deviance, and participation</li>
        <li>Fragmentation, Randomness and Playfulness</li>
        <li>Reorganization of the hierarchical order and empowerment of the periphery</li>
        <li>Indeterminacy and Uncertainty</li>
        <li>Convergence and spread of genres</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Hypertext, which is made up of connections between individual bodies, can be infinitely decentralized and recentered at the same time. The center in hypertext exists as a function, not as a matter itself. In the connection between information, meeting as a drifting document. Conjunction means that two terms meet equally to create a third, something new. There is no consequence in connection, and there is no selection of likes or dislikes. Documents that are beautifully connected to each other with links form the roots of rhizome and create stories while oriented to the outside and in expansion of each other. It is an entity that radically and completely changes the way we read.</p>

    <p>The primary function of digital text, whether it be tables or tables of contents, annotations, cross-references, bookmarks or other resources, will eventually be hyperlinks. In fact, the table of contents, annotations, and bookmarks are all elements that end up as hyperlinks. You can link and connect paragraphs and pages without distinguishing large and small sections, and you can create links between them even more fun. Only one target can move from one source, but there can be multiple sources moving to the same target. There are endless ways to use this to create a knitted net of information.</p>

    <p>We have yet to incorporate the hypertext system into documents in the dizzying and unique way we imagined at the beginning. Hypertext has not yet changed the paradigm of how we read. But ultimately, as Ted Nelson -who first devised hypertext- said, ‘the ultimate goal of computers is human freedom’, the values ​​should be maintained.</p>


    <h4>Alt-text: To read together</h4>

    <p>Text alternatives are text description systems embedded in websites that make visual content accessible to people who are blind, have low vision, or have certain cognitive disabilities. Blind people often use software called screen readers to access digital displays. Screen readers output text on the screen as synthesized speech or a refreshable braille display. The screen reader reads the options in the navigation bar, then headings, then paragraphs. When it encounters an image, it cannot “read” the image. Instead, it finds and reads the “alternative text” associated with the image included in the code. The same applies to hyperlinks. Alternate text should be included that explains how invisible or non-visible elements work. Alternative text works like this as a non-visual alternative to a document.</p>

    <p>Such a request can also become a new imagination and creation itself. A representative example is the <em><a href="https://alt-text-as-poetry.net/">Alt-text as poetry</a></em> project. Alt-Text as Poetry, a collaboration between artists Bojana Coklyat and Shannon Finnegan, is a project that questions how to approach alternative text thoughtfully and creatively, “often ignored as an unwelcome burden to solve with minimal effort.” The project brings together a workshop to reframe the alternative text into a kind of poetry, talk about it, and provide an opportunity to practice writing. They say that the experience of writing an ‘alternative’ text that has not been written in writing can be a new creation and poetry.<span class="n1"><span class="n2">Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook, <a href="https://alt-text-as-poetry.net/">https://alt-text-as-poetry.net/</a></span></span></p>

    <p>The organization of the document also seemed to express the project's mandate in its form. The greetings were attached with voices recorded by the authors themselves, and documents were distributed in a wide variety of document extensions, including audiobooks. It also provides multiple views for discovery by a wide range of users, regardless of device, and always has a large table of contents and anchors on the right side for quick, non-linear movement from section to section. In addition to alternative methods such as alternative text, it shows that the accessibility of documents can be expanded through information hierarchy and visual structure</p>

    <p>Alternative text makes documents more accessible and usable. It is an extension of options. However, it is also important to know that these alternative texts are also part of the web accessibility considerations. The accessibility of documents is something that writers, editors, producers should actively and consequently think about without being confined to or settling for existing frameworks and regulations</p>

    <h3>Liberated Document</h3>
    <section>
    <p>By letting the text flow along the structure, it liberates the design process.<span class="n1"><span class="n2"> ‘As a result, the potential of digital publishing is linked to liberating discourse, reducing reliance on the existing publishing industry and enabling artistic autonomy. As early as the late 1990s, self-publishing artists saw the development of digital publishing as an opportunity to work more autonomously, free from unwanted limitations.’, Sylvie Boulanger,  <em>NO-ISBN: On Self-publishing</em>, p.329</span></span> The logic of the web is truly fascinating. Structure and format are distinct, and format format is not dependent on software. It is possible to create, modify, share, and improve documents without relying on a specific tool. We must recognize that we ourselves must not be left out in technology. With access to technology and a desire to avoid reliance on software, tools will be democratized and publishing practices will face a new transition</p>


    <h4>If you want more than meets the eye</h4>

    <p>As mentioned earlier, a typical modern desktop publishing is created via a WYSIWYG word processor/text editor such as Microsoft Word(.doc), edited and designed with InDesign, then exported to PDF and printed. WYSIWYG stands for ‘What You See Is What You Get,’ meaning that in desktop publishing, the edition we’ll have is exactly what the visuals on the workstation look like. WYSIWYG is the dominant paradigm for current text-editing applications, where users directly compose and style text inline with real-time updated previews. <span class="n1"><span class="n2">Critical explanation of WYSIWYG, Wouter Soudan, <em>‘From Word to Markdown to InDesign’</em>. <a href="http://rhythmus.be/md2indd/#fn4">http://rhythmus.be/md2indd/#fn4</a></span></span> Just like an image captured by a camera, only one printed version is created. The roots of printing(in paper) within PDF are so deep that we can’t even think of escaping the limits.</p>

    <p>If you want to proceed with the conversion process to e-books and websites in order to be viewed in other media or through other reading methods according to the above method, a new ‘image’ must be completely reconstructed. This is because there is not structured data, but a sheet of paper. Although we all know this is an inconvenient process, the reason we have to craft like stitches page by page is because the tools we use every day don’t show it any other way. It’s because we’ve gotten so used to paper under glass, where users don’t have to differentiate between formatting and structure (essential in the free document world). Not because of the user, but because of the interface presented to the user. Even in WYSIWYG it is possible to work in a structured way using style definitions instead of manually applying formatting, but you are left with a UI that seems to have eliminated that possibility, and not the data that actually stores the structure. For this reason, after PDF creation, it has to be forcibly torn apart (via an automated reading system) and reconstructed or converted.</p>

    <p>There are obviously some things that are changing. Further development of the technology by Adobe has allowed it to be used with Microsoft Word and InDesign to create 'interactive' publications in PDF format. It is also possible to automatically convert it to EPUB or HTML. But in the end, it was a static InDesign document upgraded with some interactive layers, and still a very limited version compared to the possibilities of the digital document format. Well, the additional ability to add structure to PDFs in Indesign has since been updated as well.</p>

    <p class="indent">When you export to Adobe PDF with the [Create Tagged PDF] option selected in the [General] area of the Export Adobe PDF dialog box, the exported pages are automatically tagged with a set of structure tags that describe the content, identifying page items such as headlines, stories, and figures. To add additional tags or to fine-tune existing ones before you export, you can use the [Tags] panel in InDesign. The Structure pane (View > Structure > Show Structure) reflects the changes.
    <br>
    You can improve the accessibility and reuse of Adobe PDF documents by adding tags to the InDesign document before you export. If your PDF documents don’t contain tags, Adobe Reader or Acrobat may attempt to automatically tag the document when the user reads or reflows it, but the results may be disappointing.</p>

    <p class="indent">The following is an explanation of the advantages that can be had by using tags like this.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>By applying tags to your document before exporting to PDF, you can do the following:</li>
        <li>Map InDesign paragraph style names to Acrobat tagged Adobe PDF paragraph styles to create a reflowable PDF file for viewing on handheld devices and other media.</li>
        <li>Mark and hide printing artifacts, text, and images so that they won’t appear when reflowed in Acrobat. For example, if you tag a page item as Artifact, the page item will not be displayed when you reflow the contents of a tagged Adobe PDF document on a handheld device, a small display, or a monitor at a large magnification.</li>
        <li>Add alternative text to figures so that the text can be read aloud to the visually impaired with screen-reading software.</li>
        <li>Replace graphic letters, such as ornate drop-caps, with readable letters.</li>
        <li>Provide a title for a set of articles, or group stories and figures into articles.</li>
        <li>Order stories and figures to establish a reading order.</li>
        <li>Recognize tables, formatted lists, and tables of contents. Recognize which content blocks belong to the different stories.</li>
        <li>Include text formatting information such as Unicode values of characters, spacing between words, and the recognition of soft and hard hyphens.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There is no need to explain or emphasize otherwise, the benefits of structure-based liquid layout are so neatly summarized. It can be seen that it is not simply expressed as a document that is flexible and well-visible, but that it is possible to create accurate and precise documents that are more clearly positioned in addition to various uses. And such structured documentation can also open up options for more people to access through alternative text, customization, and more.</p>

    <p>It is necessary to understand the paradigm shift away from the page-oriented book printing culture. You have to start thinking again in the liquid layout out of the paper under the glass. This leads to a re-recognition and subversion of the position of design and form. In a situation where a user, not a designer, decides and selects a device, it is necessary to design a structure that allows reading through the same layer and structure in all devices, rather than redesigning for each device. Create tools that use structures to gather content and structure it. Context becomes structure, and structure becomes context. Arrange all the functions of a book in a hierarchical structure, as if the whole book were a tree with trunk, branches, and leaves. All the conditions that can be invested are spent on designing and making good molds.</p>

    <p>Documents that have been properly written and edited electronically can not only be expressed and shared in various forms, but can also be used and reused infinitely in various ways. There is no easier way at all. As the same single piece of content is used in many different formats and devices, the structure needs to be clearer and sharper. These new possibilities will require potential effort and editorial strategies. However, it will be an effort and concern to be carried out.</p>


    <h4>Find your own freedom</h4>

    <p>If you consider that all of today's books are eventually created through a single piece of software, you'll find that the current system is crazy. It is as if people all over the world are using the same pencil and notebook. In addition, we are using the pencil and notebook without properly understanding how they were made, how they work, and how they work.</p>

    <p>Let's take a closer look at the publishing labor that is still being carried out. The operator has been separated from the practical know-how for the job, with the computerization of the working machine chain, and its tools (and machines) are designed and mastered by third parties outside the publishing house. In a printing plant, workers could conceive, build, and repair machines. However, going through the WYSIWYG interface, the design and UI of the device closes the possibility that the operator (designer) can completely master the software that is the tool they use. The operator is separated from the tool and placed at the end of the chain. How can we continue to be granted creative freedom in these circumstances?<span class="n1"><span class="n2">Morgane Velut,<em>“Éditer ensemble: renouveler l’organisation technique et sociale de la chaîne éditoriale”</em>, 2021, <a href="http://morganevelut.fr/editer-ensemble/">http://morganevelut.fr/editer-ensemble/</a></span></span></p>

    <p>The need to create multiple forms and formats simultaneously, from PDF to EPUB, in the publishing chain is now also an inevitable change. And no single software can be trusted to do these things right. Poor quality, too much reliance on tools, and a lot of technical debt are probably three possible downsides, all occurring simultaneously under common proprietary software today.</p>

    <p>Freedom of use must be restored. This freedom is based on being able to handle tools for oneself, being able to do things oneself freely. An important feature of open source is that we can open the software, modify it, and then combine it again. Also, using open source and using it to create new systems and results results in spreading and revitalizing the open source community and movement. Also, truly free documentation, in addition to its own unfettered attitude, is also free (of charge). Not being paid for providing a product or service. What does not exist under the limits and limits of capital, corporations, and systems.</p>

    <p>Shared documents also require the freedom to share, that is, to show. The current editorial chain is formed in a kind of pyramid, a vertical structure, at the top of which is the publisher who can control the work from conception to distribution. The role and authority of a person who separates what should be published from what should not be published and who defines the method and format of publication cannot be ignored. However, the new web environment has become a completely independent platform and environment for publishing, unlike large commercial publishers. The web is not only free to share, but also to be an immediate, open, distributed real-time publishing platform.</p>

    <p>Democratization! The democratization of tools for creating documents and tools for displaying them (platform or web), a free document format, and an open publishing system will solve the problem of centralized editing and production rights by publishers. How will this democratization affect the future publishing production, editing and design work and finally, life?</p>
